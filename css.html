                These sdrabats must be kidding. Among all three pacts The Pact of Treating
                All Sentient Beings Equally is just out of any sense. Humans are xenophobic
                but I do believe it’s a good thing; aliens never gave us nothing but wars. 
                And now out of the blue Doroses disagree. They will make us collaborate with 
                aliens, with robots of any kind, and the next thing you learn you are a slave.
                Why would we make diplomatic or trade relations with them? Humans are superior
                in any way, we need no aliens. No, now any aggressive action towards “sentient 
                beings” may be seen as an act of treachery, and the offender would undergo criminal 
                charges. That’s bad news, especially given such a vague definition of “sentient”. 
                Should I ask a cow before slicing it whether it’s sentient? That would be hilarious 
                for sure. It will not be enough though, since my cow doesn’t understand human language,
                but deep inside it can have clever thoughts of its own, which means intelligence. What
                are the criteria to determine if a creature is sentient? How are they even going to 
                propagate such laws? How will it affect hunting? Will they issue binoculars that will tell
                you wether a game is sentient or not?

                This is nonsense. And this is misery. Through the Old Times humans created a 
                magnificent empire that could destroy any aliens or robots on its path. Yes, 
                they had eventually a war against robots of their own creation, but that’s exactly 
                why we shouldn’t collaborate with robots. The pact instead states that we had a war
                 because we used them, and if we’d had treated them as equal beings, there would have 
                 been no war. So, this is what Doroses believe. These idiots tell us that in order
                  to live a content life we must make peace with robots and aliens o

        These sdrabats must be kidding. Among all three pacts The Pact of Treating
        All Sentient Beings Equally is just out of any sense. Humans are xenophobic

        And now out of the blue Doroses disagree. They will make us collaborate with 
        aliens, with robots of any kind, and the next thing you learn you are a slave
